# maze-generator-and-solver
Uses Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm to generate a random but solvable maze, then uses Dijkstra's Shortest Path First Algorithm to draw the shortest solution.

Instructions:
1. Clone the repo whichever method you prefer
2. Open the "MainWindow.java" file from "maze/src/main/java/mazes/gui/" directory
3. Compile and run MainWindow - the MazeGenerator should pop up
4. Create a "Grid" (rectangular) or "Voronoi" (cellular) type maze
5. Various maze generator algorithms - Kruskal's guarantees a random but solvable maze
6. Find shortest path

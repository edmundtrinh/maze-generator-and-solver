# maze-generator-and-solver
Uses Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm to generate a random but solvable maze, then uses Dijkstra's Shortest Path First Algorithm to draw the shortest solution.

Instructions:
1. Clone the repo whichever method you prefer
2. Open the "MainWindow.java" file from "maze/src/main/java/mazes/gui/" directory
3. Compile and run MainWindow - the MazeGenerator should pop up
    a. There are customizeable dimensions of the grid
    b. Option to create a "Grid" or "Voronoi" type maze
    c. Various maze generator algorithms - Kruskal's guarantees a random but solvable maze
    d. Find shortest path
